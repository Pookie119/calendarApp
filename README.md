# My Calendar App

## Overview
Welcome to MyCalendarApp - My very first full-fledged project as a self-taught, aspiring programmer! Beyond honing me new found skills by working on something practical and functional, this project focused on implementing what I have learned about Java, software design, data management.  

MyCalendar App is a Java-based application designed to help users manage their schedules by adding, removing, and viewing events on a calendar. The application features a GUI implemented using AWT, allowing users to interact with the calendar visually.

> - **Add Events:** Allows the user to schedule specific events on a specific date and time.
> - **Remove Events:** Allows the user to simply delete a scheduled event.
> - **Month & Year Navigation:** Allows for the ability to select any month and any year from the current up until 2050.
> - **Event Conflict:** The program will warn the user if they are double booking a time slot by checking if an exsiting event is already scheduled at the same time and date.
> - **Real-Time Updating:** The calendar interface is immediately updated following the removal or adding of a event.

## Technologies Used
**Java:** This was the core programming language used for developing the application.
**AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit):** Used to create the app's GUI.
**Java Collections Framework:** Used for management of the users events. Specifically by utilizing a map structure for efficient starage and retrival
**JSON:** Utilized for reading and writting event data to files in JSON format so that user events where properly stored and not lost between app uses.
